### Ocean Projections

Code for our data analysis and programs designed to help create data-driven quilts.

# Artist Statement

Quilts have always been a medium of storytelling, stories of poverty, stories of wealth, stories of life, and stories of death. They represent something personal, the birth of a new child, a marriage, elements of faith. We seek to tell a less personal story and through the virtue of our medium make it personal. This is the story of a changing climate in the local waters that surround us and the effect it has on ocean life. It's one that is usually told in the language of scientific data. But here, it is told through soft textiles that can be felt and touched in the domestic space. We hope that this work serves as a pattern for taking data and projecting it into our lives.
